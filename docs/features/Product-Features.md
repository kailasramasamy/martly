# Product Features — Grocery SaaS Platform

One product, four tiers. Each tier builds on the previous one.

---

## Tier 1: Digital Catalog & Offers (Future)
*Status: Not built yet. Build only when client demand is validated.*

Replaces paper flyers and WhatsApp broadcasts with a digital storefront.

- Product catalog with categories, images, prices
- Weekly/daily offers and promotions management
- Store info (hours, location, contact)
- Web and app-based — customers can browse, not order
- Store owner can update products and offers from admin panel
- Shareable links for WhatsApp/social media distribution

**Who it's for:** Stores that want digital presence but aren't ready for online ordering.
**Upsell trigger:** "Customers are browsing — can they order through this too?"

## Tier 2: Customer Engagement & Loyalty (Future)
*Status: Not built yet. Build only when client demand is validated.*

Drives repeat visits and customer retention.

- Repeat customer tracking and insights
- Customer segmentation (frequent buyers, inactive, new)
- Automated reminders (e.g., "You usually buy milk around this time")
- Festival/occasion-based promotional campaigns

**Who it's for:** Stores that want to increase repeat business without changing operations.
**Upsell trigger:** "Loyalty works better when tied to actual orders — let's add ordering."

## Tier 3: Store Intelligence (Ready)
*Status: Built and integrated into the grocery app.*

Operational intelligence dashboard for store owners. Analyzes data to make smarter decisions.

- **Anomaly Detection:** Flags unusual patterns — sudden demand spikes, unexpected drops, potential waste
- **AI Product Descriptions:** Auto-generates product descriptions for catalog/app listings
- **Sales Analytics:** Revenue trends, top-selling products, slow movers, peak order times
- **Stock Health:** Expiry tracking, wastage indicators, inventory turnover rates
